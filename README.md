## Contributions

This project is open to contributions, as well as feedback. But I recommend creating an issue for it, or contacting me on Discord to discuss about it. My Discord: Ahnaf#4346

## Idea

I got this idea from a friend of mine from the Tantei Wa Mou, Shindeiru Discord server. His idea was to make something like Plex, but for Light Novels. Users can have their LN PDFs scattered all across their computers, add them to the application, and access them through the centralised UI and read them. Later, I plan on adding mobile support so that users on the same network (or external network with IP) can read LNs on the go.
