# Web Client

This is the web frontend for the project, made with React. All you need for this is to have Node.js installed (I used v18.7.0)

## Run it

Configure [`src/config.json`](src/config.json) and set your Data API and Local API URLS properly.

Install dependencies using

```
npm install     # or yarn
```

Now run the server with

```
npm start       # or yarn start
```
